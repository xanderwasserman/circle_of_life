# Circle of Life Game

This simple Python based game was created for a flash challenge at work. The topic of the challenge was "The Circle of Life". Competitors had one hour from when the topic was announced to create something (not necessarily programming based) to present at the end of the challenge.

This game was created from the 'Snake Game' template found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-snake-game-using-turtle-in-python/).

## Running the game:

Clone this repository and run the `circle_of_life.py` file with python:
```bash
python3 circle_of_life.py
``` 

Navigate the snake using the W,S,A,D keyboard keys. The game resets automatically when dying. High scores are only kept for as long as the window remains open.

Enjoy :-)
